                <p>“I cannot express enough gratitude to Pharmainsight for simplifying my life. As a person who requires constant medication, I can say that it was very hard to spend many hours calling pharmacies or driving the city in search of specific drug I needed. With Pharmainsight I find the exact location of my drug literally in seconds. It is a game changer for me.”</p>

                <p>“Pharminsight totally changed my perception of buying pharmaceuticals. This winter I needed to buy a drug for my sick daughter, and even the thought of driving through all this snowstorm was terrible. Thanks to Pharmainsight, I instantly found the drugs from near pharmacies and ordered a delivery. I did not waste any valuable time and my daughter went fine. Service is a must for mothers all over the world.”</p>

                <p>“I am a healthcare professional, and I recommend Pharmainsight to all my patients. Many of them struggle to find the right medications, which delay the right treatment. Sometimes the pharmacists replace the drugs I prescribe, and it is not always an equal replacement. I am glad that today my patients have the opportunity to quickly find quality drugs. It influences the course of the disease and recovery.”</p>

            <p>Company Information: Background on Pharmainsight and its founder, Michael Kutuzov.</p>
            <p>We want to offer the pharmaceutical market a new service – finding drugs in the pharmacy nearby. The pain point of my customers is that not all the prescribed or needed drugs can be found in any pharmacy. Many customers must go through long trips searching for the medicines they need. It is frustrating when doctors prescribe a long list of drugs and people spend long time collecting in different pharmacies in the city. In our company, we facilitate trade between the pharmacy stores and buyers.</p>
